# CAA-Data-Analysis-Project

Our Fall 2020 Data Science Discovery Program research project was conducted under the guidance of the Cal Alumni Association. Our goal is to understand and analyze subscriber engagement in the past year with the CalCon newsletter, a monthly email newsletter for the UC Berkeley alumni community, in order to present actionable insights.

This project was created to not only understand more about the individuals who are subscribed, but also to identify highly-engaged content, grow the size of active subscribers, and sustain overall engagement with the alumni community.
