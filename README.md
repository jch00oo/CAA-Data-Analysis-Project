# CAA-Data-Analysis-Project

Our Fall 2020 Data Science Discovery Program research project was conducted under the guidance of the Cal Alumni Association. Our goal is to understand and analyze subscriber engagement in the past year with the CalCon newsletter, a monthly email newsletter for the UC Berkeley alumni community, in order to present actionable insights.

This project was created to not only understand more about the individuals who are subscribed, but also to identify highly-engaged content, grow the size of active subscribers, and sustain overall engagement with the alumni community.

## Understanding CalCon Engagement (10/2019 - 9/2020)

In the context of the CalCon newsletter, engagement is segmented in three ways:
1. *Subscribers*: individuals signed up to receive CalCon monthly newsletters
2. *Openers*: subcribers who have opened an email newsletter
3. *Clickers*: Openers who have clicked a URL link

Alumni who are subscribed to the newletter but have not opened or clicked a link in CalCons between October 2019 and September 2020 are defined as *non-engagers*. Roughly 78,641 subscribers fall in this category, with respect to the indicated time period.

Of all subscribers, over half (55%) of those subscribed to CalCon have opened a newsletter between October 2019 and September 2020. A subscriber averages roughly 2.6 opens within the specified time frame; the average number of opens between those who have opened at least once is 4.7 opens.



15% of those subscribed to CalCon engaged with a newsletter by clicking between October 2019 and September 2020. A subscriber averages roughly .13 clicks within the specified time frame. The average number of clicks for subscribers who have opened at least once is .54 clicks.

## Opens-to-clicks Conversion Rate

The conversion rate between opens to clicks is defined as the number of people who have clicked a link over the number of people who have opened a CalCons newsletter. The overall opens-to-clicks conversion rate is 0.23697, indicating that about 24% of people who opened a newsletter in the past year clicked on a link at least once.
